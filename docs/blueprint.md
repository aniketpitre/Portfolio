# **App Name**: Aniket Pitre Virtual Environment (APVE)

## Core Features:

- Secure Shell Handshake: Simulates an SSH connection sequence to establish a secure tunnel, creating a sense of accessing a real system.
- System Monitor Dashboard: Presents a live-updating dashboard with mock system data (CPU, Memory, Network I/O) and navigation links as 'Running Daemons'.
- Interactive Kubernetes Cluster: Visualizes projects as 'Pods' within a 2.5D/3D Kubernetes cluster. Hovering provides tech stack details, and clicking triggers a 'deployment' animation to access the project demo. The LLM will act as a 'tool', to determine if the description matches tech stack details
- Audit Log Emulation: Displays career history styled as a system log file, with clickable entries expanding to show full details.
- Credentials Manager Interface: Showcases education and awards as digital badges, with a featured award displaying full details upon clicking.
- Interactive Shell: Provides a functional command-line interface for navigation and direct content access (e.g., listing directories, displaying bio, accessing Kubernetes cluster view).
- Easter Egg Security Message: Responds to forbidden commands (e.g., sudo rm -rf /) with a 'COMMAND DENIED' message and a humorous security-related response.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2146C7) to evoke a sense of security, technology and trust.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#0A0F29) for a high-tech, terminal-like feel.
- Accent color: Bright cyan (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements, call-to-actions and visual prominence.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for headlines. Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif for body. 
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced for the command-line interface.
- Use system-style icons to mimic a Linux environment.
- Employ subtle animations to bring the interface to life, highlighting interactive elements, like pods.

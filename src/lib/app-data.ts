ACCESS GRANTED. DISPLAYING USER RECORD:
----------------------------------------
I‚Äôm Aniket Pitre, an MCA postgraduate student driven by curiosity and innovation. My core interests lie in Cybersecurity, Linux, and Cloud technologies, where I enjoy exploring how systems work, how they break, and how to make them stronger. I focus on learning, experimenting, and applying concepts to solve real-world problems, while continuously expanding my skills across modern IT landscapes. With a vision to grow as a security and cloud-focused professional, I aim to create impactful solutions that blend technology, security, and efficiency.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in research, projects, and collaborations that challenge me to think critically and creatively. My journey so far has been shaped by hands-on experience in system administration, vulnerability management, and cloud-based problem solving, along with a strong drive to keep exploring new technologies. I believe in combining technical skills with a forward-looking vision, contributing to solutions that are not only secure and reliable but also innovative and sustainable.
